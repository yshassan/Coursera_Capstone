### Part 2: A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem.

Firstly we will need to scrape postal location data of Birmingham and London to start with. Then retrieve the coresponding latitude & longittude coordinates of each postcode via geopy. If not then perhaps another website to scrape the information. Wikipedia tables will suffice for post code data scrape.

We will then need to make calls to the Foursquare API to request top N venue data (N to be a number determined in the project). This will then need some preprocessing to extract venue data from the raw json file.

After cleaning the data, we can prepare to run K means clustering and form clusters of post codes in Birmingham/London. The output data will try to label each post code to clusters based on venue categories they offer. We then finally discuss findings from each cluster and how they distinguish from each other.
