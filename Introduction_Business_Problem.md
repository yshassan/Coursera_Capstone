### Part 1.	A description of the problem and a discussion of the background.

In my project I will investigate in a general sense similarities betweeen postcodes in Birmingham vs London. The following geospatial analysis will review location data by postcode and aim to form clusters based on location attributes. In this case I will extract data on top venue categories and distinguish which postcodes are similar based on that feature. This could then give insight to a business owner in London to expand on which postcode.

It is known that location is a essential feature for a store or business to perform well. In particular other types of venues could drive footfall to neighbouring venues. Hence a business owner could using clustering to examine areas that are in favourable clusters. I will observe the venues of each post code and and form map visualisations to examine clusters.
